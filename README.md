# Staten
> An attempt at a digital state for the future

Leveraging the principles of open source and modern technologies to create a platform for a digital state. 

## Vision

A policy platform covering all the important issues.
 
 - Economic policies based on *Modern Monetary Theory*.
 - Social policies ensuring reduced inequality and guaranteed living wage.
 - Health policy covering all procedures with no cost to the patient. Strong mental health policies.
 - Ambitious environmental policy.

### How
 
National currency built on a blockchain with strong individual privacy rights. Having every transaction stored on a blockchain will open up for implementing policies based on algorithms.

Before that the project needs to gain traction and momentum. This can be done through several stages. I believe the focus should be on gaining contributors in the beginning before appealing to voters leading up to a national election. 

### Challenges

> Democratic theorists have identified a trilemma due to the presence of three desirable characteristics of an ideal system of direct democracy, which are challenging to deliver all at once. These three characteristics are participation – widespread participation in the decision making process by the people affected; deliberation – a rational discussion where all major points of view are weighted according to evidence; and equality – all members of the population on whose behalf decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their views taken into account. Empirical evidence from dozens of studies suggests deliberation leads to better decision making.The most popularly disputed form of direct popular participation is the referendum on constitutional matters.
