# Staten
> An attempt at a digital state for the future

Leveraging the principles of open source and modern technologies to create a platform for a digital state. 

This project is currently a personal collection of concepts gathered with the intention to create a roadmap to expand on. It's early days!

## Vision

A platform for developing policies implemented as [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_regulation). All data owned by users. Business logic and transactions recorded with three-way encryption(?) on ledger. Anonymised or aggregate data recorded on open ledger. State as a "black box". Economic policies based on *Modern Monetary Theory*. Test driven.

It's probably a good idea to leave politics and ideologies out of this project. Implementing a digital state should increase participation, deliberation and equality. Once implemented, by a political party, policies can be developed and voted on.

### How
 
National currency built on a blockchain with strong individual privacy rights. Every physical object modelled with relevant properties. Having every transaction stored on a blockchain will open up for implementing policies based on algorithms.

Before that the project needs to gain traction and momentum. This can be done through several stages. I believe the focus should be on attracting collaborators on this project, while encouraging attempts at actually implementing the platform by independent projects in whatever country where they may be.
