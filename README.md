# Staten
> An attempt at a digital state for the future

Leveraging the principles of open source and modern technologies to create a platform for a digital state. 

This project is currently a personal collection of concepts gathered with the intention to create a roadmap to expand on. It's early days!

## Vision

A policy platform covering all the important issues.
 
 - Economic policies based on *Modern Monetary Theory*.
 - Social policies ensuring reduced inequality and guaranteed living wage.
 - Health policy covering all procedures with no cost to the patient. Strong mental health policies.
 - Ambitious environmental policy.
 
All policies implemented as [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_regulation). All data owned by users. Aggregate data used for statistics.

### How
 
National currency built on a blockchain with strong individual privacy rights. Having every transaction stored on a blockchain will open up for implementing policies based on algorithms.

Before that the project needs to gain traction and momentum. This can be done through several stages. I believe the focus should be on gaining contributors in the beginning before appealing to voters leading up to a national election. 

### Challenges

#### Democratic reform trilemma

Description from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy#Democratic_reform_trilemma):
> Democratic theorists have identified a trilemma due to the presence of three desirable characteristics of an ideal system of direct democracy, which are challenging to deliver all at once. These three characteristics are participation – widespread participation in the decision making process by the people affected; deliberation – a rational discussion where all major points of view are weighted according to evidence; and equality – all members of the population on whose behalf decisions are taken have an equal chance of having their views taken into account. Empirical evidence from dozens of studies suggests deliberation leads to better decision making.The most popularly disputed form of direct popular participation is the referendum on constitutional matters.

- Participation
  - [Delegative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy) allows for vesting voting power in delegates, and lies between direct democracy and representative democracy.
- Deliberation
  - Policies implemented as algorithms can be worked on and improved indefinitely like any open source project. 
- Equality
  - Votes can be weighted based on how the proposed policy will impact affected individuals.

#### Security and the protection of privacy

Description from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy#Security_and_the_protection_of_privacy):
> The government must be in a position to guarantee that online communications are secure and that they do not violate people's privacy. This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent ballot rigging or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. Electronic voting in Estonia is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems.

#### Government responsiveness

Description from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy#Government_responsiveness):
> In order to attract people to get involved in online consultations and discussions, the government must respond to people and actively demonstrate that there is a relationship between the citizen's engagement and policy outcome. It is also important that people are able to become involved in the process, at a time and place that is convenient to them but when their opinions will count. The government will need to ensure that the structures are in place to deal with increased participation.
> In order to ensure that issues are debated in a democratic, inclusive, tolerant and productive way, the role that intermediaries and representative organizations may play should be considered. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing legal rights of access to information held by public authorities, citizens should have the right to effective public deliberation and moderation.
