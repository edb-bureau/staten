# Staten
> An attempt at a digital state for the future

Leveraging the principles of open source and modern technologies to create a platform for a digital state. 

## Vision

A policy platform covering all the important issues.
 
 - Economic policies based on *Modern Monetary Theory*.
 - Social policies ensuring reduced inequality and guaranteed living wage.
 - Health policy covering all procedures with no cost to the patient. Strong mental health policies.
 - Ambitious environmental policy.

### How
 
National currency built on a blockchain with strong individual privacy rights. Having every transaction stored on a blockchain will open up for implementing policies based on algorithms.

Before that the project needs to gain traction and momentum. This can be done through several stages. I believe the focus should be on gaining contributors in the beginning before appealing to voters leading up to a national election.
